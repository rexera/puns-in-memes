# 🤔…But in Another Language? Puns in Memes Datasets for Cross-Lingual Humor Explanation

Welcome to the official repository for our project on **cross-lingual humor understanding**! Ever wondered if AI can explain why that English meme is funny in Mandarin, or decode a classic Chinese pun in English? Well, that's exactly what we're here to find out! 🧠💡

## What’s All This About?

This project is dedicated to collecting and analyzing **memes with puns** from both English and Chinese. We aim to see if large language models (LLMs) can accurately explain jokes from one language in another, taking into account **linguistic and cultural nuances**. The end goal? To see if AI can “get the joke” just as well as a human, and if not…why? 🤷

### 🔍 Key Features:

- **Dataset Construction**: We’ve curated a rich, diverse collection of bilingual memes filled with puns and linguistic gems. Think of it as a *Tower of Babel*, but with memes! 🌍🎨
- **Model Testing**: Various models and strategies are put to the test. Can they cross that language barrier without losing the punchline? We’re experimenting with **DPO**, **Few-Shot**, **CoT**, and more!
- **Evaluation**: The final verdict isn’t left to machines alone. A panel of **human reviewers**, fluent in both languages, weighs in to see if the models really understand what's funny or if they’re just pretending. 😅

### 📂 The Dataset

Our dataset—**Puns in Memes (PiM)**—features bilingual meme treasures, where we challenge AI to explain humor across languages. You’ll find:

1. **Clever Wordplay**: Bilingual puns with visual scenarios that make you giggle (or groan).
2. **Cultural Quirks**: References that are funny in one culture but confusing in another. Can AI bridge the cultural gap?
3. **Human Annotations**: We even get real people to provide explanations, making sure our data is gold-standard. 🌟

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Train & Test**: We train state-of-the-art language models to explain jokes in both English and Chinese. Then, we put them through a **bilingual comedy gauntlet**.
2. **Human Comparison**: AI vs. humans: who explains the joke better? The audience votes! 🗳️
3. **Error Analysis**: When models flop, we dig deep. Did the AI miss a pun? Fail to grasp the cultural context? We’ll find out! 🕵️

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Our evaluation uses **human preference ratings** and **objective metrics** like response time and error rates. We want to know not just *if* the AI gets it right, but *how well* it performs compared to humans.

### 🤯 Why Does It Matter?

Understanding humor across languages can help improve **cross-cultural communication**, and who knows—maybe one day your AI will be cracking jokes in multiple languages. It’s also a fun way to explore the **limits of LLMs** and how machines interpret the human condition. 🤖😂

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

To run the code, simply clone this repo, install the dependencies, and you’re ready to start teaching AI what’s funny!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rexera/puns-in-memes.git
cd Puns-in-Memes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🤹 Fun Fact:

Did you know the word for “pun” in Chinese is **双关** (shuāngguān), which literally means “double meaning”? Just like a great pun, our dataset brings together **two languages** for double the fun! 🧩

### 🤔 Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or drop us a line at: mayiran@bupt.edu.cn. 
We promise not to respond in puns. (Okay, maybe just one or two.) 😉

Happy meme-ing! 🎉
